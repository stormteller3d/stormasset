## About native assets

Two assets can be found in the received file, once the addon is installed, they must be ready to be added to your .blend scene.

### The book 

The file of this asset has few modifications compared to the original posted on the Blender subreddit, this has been integrated into the add-on to test the possibility of creating different assets.

**Note 1:** Node groups are still confused

**Note 2:** A new version of the book is still in development and will be released with the addon

**Note 3:** This version is not optimized for low poly uses

### The vase

This asset was created especially for the addon, in order to extensively test the procedural possibilities.

**Note:** Like the book, this asset is a work in progress, but it already has most of the planned procedural parameters
