##About native assets

Two assets can be found in the received file, once the addon is installed, they must be ready to be added to your .blend scene.

------The book ------

The file of this asset has few modifications compared to the original posted on the Blender subreddit, it was inserted with the addon to test the possibility of creating different assets.
Note 1: Node groups are still confused
Note 2: a new version of the book is still in development and will be released with the addon
Note 3: this version is not optimized for low poly uses

------The vase ------

This asset was created especially for the addon, in order to extensively test the procedural possibilities.
Note: Like the book, this asset is a work in progress, but it already has most of the planned procedural parameters
